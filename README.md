=====================

Modified Twine build target with Unity3D webplayer macros.

Meant to be used with a (maybe) forthcoming Unity asset that talks to
Twine. Sends messages to a `TwineScript` GameObject in the current Unity
scene. Implement functions with the same name as your method in a
behavior script on the `TwineScript` object.
